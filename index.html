            <pre style="font-size: 15pt;">
    This summer, <a href ="https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/dust-storm-engulfs-mars/" target="_blank">a global dust storm encircled Mars</a>, blocking much of the vital solar
    energy that NASA’s Opportunity rover needs to survive. After months of
    listening for a signal, the agency has declared that the longest-lived rover to
    explore Mars has come to the end of its mission. Originally slated for a three-
    month mission, the Opportunity rover lived a whopping 14.5 years on Mars.
    Opportunity beat the odds many times while exploring the Red Planet, returning
    an abundance of scientific data that paved the way for future exploration.

    Scientists and engineers are celebrating this unprecedented mission success,
    still analyzing data collected during the past decade and a half and applying
    lessons learned to the design of future spacecraft. For teachers, this historic
    mission provides lessons in engineering design, troubleshooting and scientific discovery.

    Launched in 2003 and landed in early 2004, the <a href ="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-exploration-rovers-spirit-and-opportunity/" target="_blank">twin Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity</a>, 
    sent on a mission to explore and map out the harsh grounds of Mars. The two reached land for the first time in June 2008 and began their exploration. 
    After sending data and images back to Earth one of the rovers met a tragic end as it was caught under a <a href ="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/gusev-crater/" target="_blank">sand trap</a>, and not being able to
    receive sunlight to recharge its battery, its mission came to an abrupt end on March 22 2010 after 6 years of operation. 
    However, Opportunity was still in operation. Stranded and alone, Opportunity continued its operation around Mars. 
    Celebrating its birthday by singing "Happy birthday" on its own on the vast empty space of Mars.
    But sadly, eventually its mission didn't last forever as Opportunity was roaming around the planet surface, a massive dust storm struck the planet, ravaging 
    everything that was caught in its path, and Opportunity was one of them. Despite this Opportunity stood strong and still under the heavy storm, refusing to budge.
    Even if left still intact, Opporunity's main source of energy, that being its <a href ="www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=nasa+solar+panel&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8" target="_blank">solar panels</a> were covered in dust, blocking its only way tor receive power.
    To troubleshoot and overcome challenges during the rovers’ long mission,
    engineers would perform tests on a duplicate model of the <a href ="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/spaceships-and-rockets" target="_blank">spacecraft</a>, which
    remained on Earth for just this purpose. One such instance was in 2005, when
    Opportunity got stuck in the sand. Its right front wheel dug into loose sand,
    reaching to just below its axle. Engineers and scientists worked for five weeks to
    free Opportunity, first using images and <a href ="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-behind-the-discoveries/hubble-spectroscopy" target="_blank">spectroscopy</a> obtained by the rover’s
    instruments to recreate the sand trap on Earth and then placing the test rover in
    the exact same position as Opportunity. The team eventually found a way to get
    the test rover out of the sand trap. Engineers tested their commands repeatedly
    with consistent results, giving them confidence in their solution. The same
    commands were relayed to Opportunity through <a href ="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/what-is-the-deep-space-network" target="_blank">NASA’s Deep Space Network,</a>,
    and the patient rover turned its stuck wheel just the right amount and backed
    out of the trap that had ensnared it for over a month, enabling the mission to continue.


    Dust storm season on Mars can be treacherous for solar-powered rovers because if they are in the path of the dust storm, 
    their access to sunlight can be obstructed for months on end, longer than their batteries can sustain them.
    Though several dust storms occurred on Mars during the reign of the Mars Exploration Rovers, 2018 brought a large, 
    thick dust storm that covered the entire globe and shrouded Opportunity’s access to sunlight for four months.
    Since the last communication with Opportunity on June 10, 2018, NASA has sent more than 1,000 commands to the rover that have gone unanswered. 
    Each of these commands was an attempt to get Opportunity to send back a signal saying it was alive.
    A last-ditch effort to reset the rover’s mission clock was met with silence.
    Opportunity went silent afterwards, but not before sending one last message back to NASA.

    <font style="font-style: oblique">"My battery is low, and its getting dark"</font>

    And that marked the end of Opportunity's 15 year long operation, having reached that long the mission was considered a success.
    The twin Rovers has completed their mission and left their mark on Mars, though their legacy will live on as NASA still has Curiosity which is still active till this day
    Hopefully when the time comes, if time allows it, we will have the resources and power to reach Mars, and maybe, hopefully, recover both Rovers and bring them back home.
